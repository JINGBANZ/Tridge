# MyFridge — What's In My Fridge

Scan your grocery receipt → an LLM turns it into a live fridge inventory with
expiration dates → items float on a minimal home screen, turning amber, then red,
as they near expiry. Drag an item to "😋 Ate it" or "🗑️ Tossed" when it leaves
the fridge.

**Status: design phase.** The complete design & build spec (with screen mocks)
lives at [`design/fridge-design.html`](design/fridge-design.html) — open it in a
browser. Agents: start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), then [`wiki/index.md`](wiki/index.md).

## Planned v1

- LLM receipt scanning (VisionKit capture → Claude vision call → review sheet)
- Expiry tracking with local notifications (T−2 days and expiry day)
- Game-inventory-style home grid, sorted soonest-expiring first
- Drag-to-consume, on-device OCR for printed "best by" dates
- iOS 17+, SwiftUI + SwiftData, no third-party packages, no backend
